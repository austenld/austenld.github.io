title: Reduced Field Strength $$(E/N)$$
---

Experimentally, $$K$$ is understood to be constant at low reduced field
strengths. This post examines why this parameter is useful with
simulations where reduced field strength $$(E/N)$$ is altered.

Key IMS Scaling Factor ($$E/N$$- Reduced Field Strength)
======================================================

$$E/N$$ is known as the reduced field strength.

No Electric Field ($$E/N=0$$)
---------------------------

First, we can consider the effect when ions are confined in a box in the
presence of neutrals without the presence of an electric field. The red
squares represent the ions and the blue dots correspond to the neutrals
present. Without the presence of an electric field, the ions travel in a
pattern of motion known as Brownian motion. The ions behave similarly to
that of the neutral gasses.

Applied Constant Electric Field
-------------------------------

Now the motion of the ions change when a constant electric field is
applied. The voltage decreases linearly in the direction from left to
right.

Double Electric Field
---------------------

The ions travel with a higher terminal velocity $$(v_d)$$ when the
electric field is doubled proportional to the defined mobility $$(K)$$ of
the ion population.

Double Electric Field and Number Density
----------------------------------------

The reduced field strength remains constant when the number density and
electric field are doubled. The animation on the right highlights that
the terminal velocity $$(v_d)$$ of the ion population is similar to the
animation in the left.
