title: Reduced Field Strength
---
Key IMS Scaling Factor ($$E/N$$- Reduced Field Strength)
======================================================

$$E/N$$ is known as the reduced field strength. Experimentally, $$K$$ is
understood to be constant at low reduced field strengths. We shall now
see why this parameter is useful by observing from this simulation the
effect of varying the reduced field strength $$(E/N)$$.

No Electric Field ($$E/N=0$$)
---------------------------

First, we can consider the effect when ions are confined in a box in the
presence of neutrals without the presence of an electric field. The red
squares represent the ions and the blue dots correspond to the neutrals
present. Without the presence of an electric field, the ions travel in a
pattern of motion known as Brownian motion. The ions behave similarly to
that of the neutral gasses.
