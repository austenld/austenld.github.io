### IMS Theory Introduction
This is an introduction to the basics of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS).
The purpose of this page is to introduce you to the concept of IMS and how ions behave in neutral gasses.
The structure and content of this page is based upon lecture slides provided by Dr. Bill Siems.

### IMS Variables
First, we need to establish the variables which will be discussed in further detail.
#### Instrument-State Variables ($$L, V, E$$) and ($$N, T, P$$):

$$L$$ is the length of the drift space and $$V$$ is the voltage drop across the drift space.
The electric field is such that $$E=\frac{V}{L}$$.
$$N$$ is the number density of the drift gas.
If the drift gas is ideal then $$N=N_0$$
