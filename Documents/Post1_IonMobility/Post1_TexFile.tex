\begin{document}
Here we introduce the commonly referenced variables which will be discussed in further detail.
\section{Variables in IMS}
The variables which will be introduced can be grouped into three distinct categories: instrument-state, mass, and measured quantities.
\subsection{Instrument-State Variables: $(L, V, E)$ and $(N, T, P)$}
$L$ is the length of the drift space and $V$ is the voltage drop across the drift space. The electric field for a traditional linear drift tube is constant and equivalent to $E=\frac{V}{L}$. $N$ is the number density of the drift gas. If the drift gas is considered ideal then $N=N_0\cdot \dfrac{P\cdot T_0}{P_0\cdot T}$, where $T_0=273.15\;$K, $P_0= 760\;$torr, and  $N_0=2.687\cdot10^{19} \text{cm}^3$ (the number density of an ideal gas at STP).
\subsection{Mass Parameters: $(m, M, q=Ze)$}
$m$ and $M$ correspond to the ion and drift gas masses respectively and $q$ corresponds to the charge of the ion.
\subsection{Measured Quantities: $(t_d, v_d)$}
$t_d$ is the drift time required for an ion swarm to traverse the length of the drift space $L$. This terminal velocity is called the drift velocity $(v_d)$. The drift velocity of a given ion population is equivalent to $v_d=\dfrac{L}{t_d}$ where the length is often predetermined and the drift time is measured.
\section{Ion Mobility ($K$)}
The mobility $(K)$ of an ion swarm is important and related to the drift velocity of an ion where $K=\frac{v_d}{E}$.
The central observation is that if an electric field $(E)$ is applied to ions dispersed in gas, the ions move with a characteristic average terminal velocity $(v_d)$ in the direction of the field. The mobility $K$ is defined as the ratio of the velocity to the field strength and is traditionally reported in units of cm$^2$V$^{-1}$sec$^{-1}$.
\section{Five Underlying Assumptions of IMS}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $n << N$: Ions have a much lower number density then neutrals (additionally, mutual coulombic repulsion of ions is unimportant, ion-ion collisions unimpportant, and each neutral encounters 0 or 1 ion during a mobility experiment).
	\item Collisions are instantaneous.
	\item Three-body collisions are rare.
	\item Ions reach a terminal velocity defined by $v_d=KE$ (vacuum and  ''low'' pressures excluded from consideration).
	\item Ion-neutral reactions and clustering may be ignored (in real experiments clustering is common).	
\end{enumerate}
